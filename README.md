# Weather Frocasting App

## Overview

Weather app allows users to check the weather for any of their favorite cities. All cities that are saved to Core Data will be listed on the initial view controller.

This app uses the Geobytes API to search for a city name as well as OpenWeatherMap API to access current weather data for selected cities. Weather App was completed as an assignment for Seneca College course in iOS Mobile Application Development by using fundamental principles as follows:

* Dependency Injection & Singleton Desing Pattern
* UISearchBar
* Network Request, API & Web Services
* Core Data & Persistence
* Core Data Stack, NSPersistentContainer and NSManagedObjectContext
* NSFetchRequest & NSFetchedResultsController
